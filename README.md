# Student Performance AI

## Overview
This project utilizes linear regression to predict students' final grades based on various input features (X). The output (Y) represents the predicted final grades. The model aims to identify patterns in student data to forecast academic performance, helping educators and students to take proactive steps.

## Project Features
- **Model**: Linear regression.
- **Objective**: Predict final grades using multiple input features.
- **Output**: Predicted final grades (Y).

## Progress Log

### Day 1 - Day 2: Data Collection & Preparation
1. **Data Collection**: Acquired student performance data from various sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned the dataset by handling missing or inconsistent values.
   - Transformed categorical data into numerical formats for compatibility with the model.
3. **Data Analysis**:
   - Explored the data by visualizing the distributions using histograms, scatter plots, and diagrams to understand feature relationships.
   
### Day 3: Model Selection & Implementation
1. **Model Choice**: Selected linear regression as the primary algorithm for its simplicity and effectiveness in modeling continuous data.
2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Identified key input features (X) that impact final grades.
   - Constructed a linear equation based on the selected features for implementation.
   
3. **Model Implementation**:
   - Trained the model using the preprocessed data.
   - Visualized the relationship between input features and the predicted outcomes.
   - Examined the linear equation to ensure model correctness and accuracy.

### Next Steps:
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
- **Optimization**: Tune the model for better accuracy.
- **Deployment**: Prepare the model for deployment and integration into a student management system.
